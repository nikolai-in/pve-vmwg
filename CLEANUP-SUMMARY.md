# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Completed Cleanup Actions

### Removed Obsolete Scripts (2024)

The following legacy scripts were removed as they are now superseded by the unified failsafe system and Ansible automation:

- `add-bridge-to-proxmox.sh` - Functionality integrated into Ansible playbook
- `check-connectivity.sh` - Replaced by `verify-setup.sh` with better integration
- `deploy.sh` - Simple wrapper; direct Ansible commands are preferred
- `fix-vm-connectivity.sh` - Ad-hoc fixes now handled by failsafe system

### Previous Cleanup (Per Conversation History)

These scripts were removed in earlier cleanup phases:

- `network-failsafe.sh` - Replaced by unified `src/network-failsafe`
- `test-failsafe.sh` - Integrated into unified script
- `quick-test-failsafe.sh` - Consolidated into unified script
- `smart-failsafe.sh` - Replaced by unified script
- `verify-failsafe.sh` - Consolidated functionality
- `context-test.sh` - Merged into unified testing
- `enhanced-verify.sh` - Consolidated into unified script
- `cleanup-failsafe.sh` - Integrated into main cleanup playbook
- `disarm-failsafe.sh` - Replaced by unified script (legacy wrapper provided)

### Documentation Cleanup

- Removed outdated markdown files (`NETWORK-FAILSAFE.md`, `TESTING-FAILSAFE.md`)
- Created new comprehensive `README.md`
- Added inline documentation in scripts

## Current Repository Structure

### Core Files

- `deploy-vmwg-subnet.yml` - Main deployment with automatic failsafe
- `cleanup-vmwg-subnet.yml` - Complete system cleanup
- `inventory.yml` - Ansible configuration
- `verify-setup.sh` - Setup verification and connectivity testing

### Unified System

- `src/network-failsafe` - Single script for all failsafe operations
- `src/recover-network.sh` - Emergency recovery
- `templates/` - Jinja2 templates for dynamic configuration

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Single entry point for failsafe operations
2. **Better Maintainability**: Consolidated code is easier to maintain
3. **Improved Safety**: Unified system with comprehensive testing
4. **Clearer Documentation**: Single README with all necessary information
5. **Modern Practices**: Ansible-first approach with proper failsafe integration

## Safety Features Retained

- Network state snapshots before changes
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- Manual failsafe control capabilities
- Emergency recovery tools
- Comprehensive status and testing commands

The repository is now clean, modern, and ready for production use.
